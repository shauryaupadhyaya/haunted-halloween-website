## 👾 Glitch & Spooky Feature (Random Haunted Effect)

One of the standout details of the Haunted Halloween 2025 site is its **Glitch & Spooky Feature**, a rare animation sequence that **appears at random intervals**, creating a haunted “ghost in the system” vibe.

### ✨ What Happens
When triggered, visitors may see:
- A **flickering haunted overlay** with ghostly distortion  
- **Screen glitching** and reversed scroll effects  
- **Random eerie text** that fades in and out  
- **Sudden flashes** of ghost images or light bursts  
- Ambient **vibration animations** for an immersive scare  

Each instance is brief and unpredictable — enhancing the sense that the page itself is alive… or possessed 👻.

### 🧩 Technical Breakdown
- Implemented using **CSS keyframes** and **JavaScript timers**
- Randomized triggers with functions that occasionally invoke glitch animations  
- Uses CSS effects like `filter: hue-rotate()`, `blur()`, and `invert()`  
- Sound or particle effects can be optionally added later
